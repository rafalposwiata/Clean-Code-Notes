# Smells and Heuristics

### Comments

- Inappropriate Information

  Comments should be reserved for technical notes about the code and design.

- Obsolete Comment

  A comment that has gotten old, irrelevant, and incorrect is obsolete.

- Redundant Comment

  A comment is redundant if it describes something that adequately describes itself.

- Poorly Written Comment

  A comment worth writing is worth writing well.

- Commented-Out Code

### Environment

- Build Requires More Than One Step

  Building a project should be a single trivial operation.
  
- Tests Require More Than One Step
  
  You should be able to run all the unit tests with just one command.

### Functions

- Too Many Arguments
  
  Functions should have a small number of arguments (max 3).
  
- Output Arguments

  Output arguments are counterintuitive.
  
- Flag Arguments

  Boolean arguments loudly declare that the function does more than one thing. They are confusing and should be eliminated.
  
- Dead Function

  Methods that are never called should be discarded.
