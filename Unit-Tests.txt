# Unit Tests

## The Three Laws of TDD

### First Law 

You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.

### Second Law 

You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.

### Third Law

You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.
