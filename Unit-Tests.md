# Unit Tests

### The Three Laws of TDD:

- You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.

- You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.

- You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

### F.I.R.S.T.

- Fast (Tests should run quickly)

- Independent (Tests should not depend on each other)

- Repeatable (Tests should be repeatable in any environment)

- Self-Validating (Tests should have a boolean output)

- Timely (Tests need to be written in a timely fashion)
